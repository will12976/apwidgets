Are you using Android Processing and want to take advantage of some of the widgets in the Android platform such as Button, EditText, CheckBox, RadioButton, RadioGroup, AnalogClock, MediaPlayer, VideoView and more? Then this project might be of interest to you.



_Code Examples_

I am in the process of making code examples. See the wiki.

So far I have made code examples for:
PButton,
PCheckBox,
PMediaPlayer ( for sound ),
PVideoView,
PEditText ( for text input ).

More examples to come.


Se the wiki for code examples.
